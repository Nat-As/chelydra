# Chelydra (Under Construction)
MITM Snapchat Exploit named after the Chelydra snapping turtle. This is an experimental script showing how packets from snapchat can be intercepted, captured and then decrypted, saving the resulting snap as a jpeg in a capture folder for future review.

## Notice
This tool should only be used on a network that is owned by the user.<br>
Due to recent changes in snapchat cryptograpy, this repository will be rebuilt some time in the future. Feel free to star or follow this repo.
